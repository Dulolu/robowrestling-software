Welcome to RoboWrestling Scaffold-i!

This directory contains a variety of functions and methods designed to provide a solid framework for teams to build their code around. This code is a starting point that can be modified and edited to suit the specific needs and goals of your robot. Feel free to use as much or as little of the scaffolding as needed.
